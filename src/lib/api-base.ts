// Base URL of the API, resolved once at module load.
//
// Every call site used to inline `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL ||
// 'http://localhost:3000'`, which was wrong twice over. The port was wrong —
// the API listens on 3001 (server/.env PORT), not Nest's 3000 default — so the
// fallback never actually helped in development. And Vite inlines
// VITE_API_BASE_URL at BUILD time, so a production build that was never given
// the variable shipped a bundle hard-coded to the developer's own machine: it
// loaded fine, then failed every request in the user's browser with a
// connection error nobody on our side ever saw.
//
// A loud failure beats a localhost bundle. Throwing on import kills the app on
// its first line, in the deploy smoke test or the first page load, instead of
// letting a dashboard that can reach nothing look perfectly healthy.
