# Production release for this Cloudflare Worker.
#
# This exists because both obvious commands are traps. Vite inlines the API base
# URL at build time, and `dist/` is simply whatever the last build left there:
#
#   - `npm run build && wrangler deploy` ships a bundle built from `.env`, which
#     points at localhost.
#   - a bare `wrangler deploy` ships whatever is already in `dist/` — and
#     `npm run build:e2e`, which the Playwright suite runs, leaves a bundle there
#     pointing at localhost:3020.
#
# The second one has already put a localhost bundle on production once: the e2e
# suite was run, then `wrangler deploy`, and the live panel spent several minutes
# calling an API on the operator's laptop. Nothing failed loudly, because a
# wrong-but-valid URL is not a build error.
#
# So the environment is required explicitly, the build is done from scratch, and
# the bundle is asserted against before anything is uploaded. The staging
# workflow has had this check since it was written; production had no equivalent
# only because its deploy was never automated.
